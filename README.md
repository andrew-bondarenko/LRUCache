# LRUCache
LRU Cache in Python!

This implementation of the LRU Cache utilizes 2 data strutures: a Circular Doubly Linked List and a Hash map. 

When the Cache is full, the least recently used (LRU) item will be evicted.

# Project Structure
In this project, there are 2 main sub-folders:
- `.\LRUCache` - contains all of the Python scripts
- `.\Tests` - contains all of the testing scripts 

# How to run the code
To run the code, you will need Python 3.

Check out this repository to your local machine.

Familiarize yourself with the test script, `.\Tests\LRUCache_Test.py`.

Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project.

From the root folder, execute:

> `python .\Tests\LRUCache_Test.py`

Observe the terminal results.
